1. Chaotic Learning with General loss of Status : learn all sorts of different things from all sorts of source, generate and forget models for things that happen in the world - this phase is hard to understand from the outside and hence results in losing status as a result of people not being able to understand the work done
2. Organised Competencies with General Success and gain of Status : You spend time in exhibiting and gathering competencies resulting in visible success and corresponding increase in status and respect. Make it easy for people to understand with easy signalling and you start building status in proportion to the signal.

Evaluated mostly on school exams, activities and other understood games among children and adults. Especially egregious advice and expectations on Career decisions, College Program Preparations and several other important dimensions of live - induces great harm in the Childâ€™s life
