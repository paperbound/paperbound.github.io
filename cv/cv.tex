	% As a Computer Science and Engineering student at the National Institute of Technology Calicut, I was given a strong initiation into Computational thinking, good mathematical foundations, knowledge of hardware architecture concepts, systems engineering, computer network infrastructure, and more. My early interests there lead me to pick up application programming in Objective C, Java, WebGL, trying to build small platform games for iOS, Android and the Web

	% During my time as a Software Engineer at an AdTech company in Bengaluru after my Bachelor's I was given ownership over sub-systems in their ad-serving layer and oversaw deployment of many components in the ad-serving API. I took charge of developing and maintaining client interfaces and SDK integrations for a Facebook Marketing partnership product and was responsible for several high value campaigns. I was part of several migration efforts from moving the earlier PHP codebase to Java, migrating systems from IBM Softlayer servers to AWS EC2 services, and moving the data pipeline to a new Kafka system.
