		<p>Ideas on Learning and Memory</p>
		<p>People perform this or that kind of learning throughout their lives for all sorts of reasons, to keep up with
			their interests, maintaining social relationships, navigating the daily routines of their lives, etc.
			Learning in this sense is as quotidian an activity as dining, however people engage in this activity in more
			intricate ways - either by the nature of their jobs (so called knowledge workers) or simply their own
			curiosity. There is also the
			matter of the different disciplines in learning - unstructured learning over considerable time intervals in
			varied domains, startegic skill making through apprenticeship, or self-learning over a smaller period of
			time and more. Regardless of the subject, there should be general principles, approaches, and strategy one
			hopes to use that can reduce the anxiety and risk involved in trying to learn.</p>
		<h2>Spaced Repetition</h2>
		<p>Leveraging the <code>Spacing Effect</code> phenomenon as a technique in learning.</p>

		<h2>Theory of Learning</h2>
		<p>MOOC offered by Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski <a
				href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn">Learning how to Learn</a></p>
		<h3>Core Ideas</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Focused</strong> and <strong>Diffused</strong> Modes of Thinking</li>
			<li>Concepts and Ideas have associations, hierarchies and come together or in <strong>chunks</strong>. They
				relate to Networks of Neurons</li>
			<li>Chunking &amp; Library of Chunks : <em>Conceptual Chunks</em> related to each other through
				<strong>Meaning</strong></li>
			<li>4-Sloted <strong>Working Memory</strong> vs Warehouse-like <strong>Long Term Memory</strong></li>
			<li>Meta-Cognition can change Cognition</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Behavioural Ideas</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Sleep is really important to Long Term Memory formation</li>
			<li>You can learn by doing: Active Engagement</li>
			<li>Spacial Nature of Learning : Exercise invokes thinking paths, embodied cognition involves environment :
				also Memory Palace Technique</li>
			<li>Temporal Nature of Learning : The Pomodoro Technique, Spaced Repetition, Chunking through Focused
				Practise and Repetition</li>
		</ul>
		<p><em>Hard-To-Vary Explanations are Lacking for most of these</em></p>
		<h3>Grit and Growth MindSet</h3>
		<p>Research may contain several faults, although the ideas and general philosophy can be useful to invoke.</p>
		<p><strong>Grit</strong> is Passion and Perseverance over long periods of time.</p>

		<p><em>Cultural memory explanations</em> as contained in the work of <a
				href="http://www.lynnekelly.com.au">Lynne Kelly</a> points to the different ways ancient cultures would
			use ritual, landscapes, structures, and other extended cognition tools to serve as cultural memory before
			the time of the written record. She also talks about philosophy expressed in popular music and music as
			knowledge tools of culture in <a
