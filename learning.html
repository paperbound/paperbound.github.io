    <h1>learning</h1>

    <p>
      People perform this or that kind of learning throughout their lives for
      all sorts of reasons. To keep up with their interests, maintaining social
      relationships, navigating the daily routines of their lives, etc.
      Learning in this sense is as quotidian an activity as dining and people
      engage in this activity in intricate ways, either by the nature of their
      jobs (so called knowledge workers) or simply their own curiosity. There
      are several ways that people approach learning, such as the unstructured
      learning that occurs over considerable time intervals across multiple
      domains, startegic skill making through apprenticeship, or self-learning.
      Regardless of the approach you use or the goal you want to achieve, there
      should be general principles, approaches, and strategies that one can use
      that can reduce the anxiety and risk involved in learning
    </p>

    <h2>spaced repetition</h2>

    <p>
      You can leverage the <code>Spacing Effect</code> phenomenon as a
      technique to learn things that you know are of value to your future self
    </p>

    <p><strong>Reasoning behind the practise</strong></p>

    <p>
      There are several interesting articles on the internet such as the <a
        href="https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition">Literature Review and
        Techniques from Gwern</a>,
      <a href="https://mullenmemory.com/memory-palace-study-hacks">
        Mullen on Memory Study Hacks</a>, and Michael Nielsen on <a
        href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">Augmenting Long-Term
        Memory</a>
    </p>

    <p><strong>Strategy and Technique</strong></p>

    <p>
      Learn research papers, textbooks, and the like by making <i>Anki</i>
      notes on top of notes/work produced while learning the Technical
      Material. A model for the same in mathematics is described by Michael
      Nielsen in <a href="http://cognitivemedium.com/srs-mathematics">SR for
        Maths</a>
    </p>

    <h2>theory of learning</h2>

    <p>
      MOOC offered by Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski <a
        href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn">
        Learning how to Learn</a> provides some interesting techincal terminology
      - such as <strong>chunking</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="https://andymatuschak.org/books/">Why books don't work</a>
      by Andy Matushak recommends readers to learn specific reflective
      strategies (metacognition) such as asking "How should I summarise what
      I'm reading?"
    </p>

    <h3>Core Ideas</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The 2 primary modes of thinking are <strong>focused</strong> &amp;
        <strong>diffused</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        Concepts, ideas have associations, hierarchies, and usually come
        together in <strong>chunks</strong> (relate to networks of neurons)
      </li>
      <li>
        Conceptual <strong>chunks</strong> related to each other through
        <i>Meaning</i>
      </li>
      <li>
        Working memory maybe 4-Sloted &amp; <i>scratchpad</i> like
      </li>
      <li>
        Long term memory may be clunk &amp; <i>warehouse</i> like
      </li>
      <li><i>Meta cognition</i> can change <i>cognition</i></li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Behavioural Ideas</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>Sleep is really important to <i>long term</i> memory formation</li>
      <li>You can learn by doing → Active Engagement</li>
      <li>
        Exercise can invoke thinking paths, environment can register memories
        (like in the memory palace technique) → Embodied Cognition
      </li>
      <li>
        Focused practise and repetition over time builds understanding
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p style="color: orangered">
      <em> Note:
        <i>hard to vary</i> explanations missing for some of these ideas
      </em>
    </p>

    <h4>Memory Palaces &amp; Ancient Techniques</h4>

    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embodied_cognition">Embodied
        Cognition</a> running on Ancient Memory Architectures
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="http://www.lynnekelly.com.au">Lynne Kelly</a> lists different
      ways that ancient cultures could have used rituals, landscapes, man-made
      structures, and other extended cognition tools to serve as <i>cultural
        memory</i> before the time of the written record. She also talks about
      philosophy expressed in (popular) music as
      <a
        href="https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2019/08/19/60-lynne-kelly-on-memory-palaces-ancient-and-modern/">
        knowledge tools of culture in Lynne’s conversation with Sean Carrol</a>
