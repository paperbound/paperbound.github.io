    <h1>human origins</h1>

    <p>
      How did the modern human mind evolve? <br>
      What happened to our cousin species? <br>
      What were the lives and stories of our ancestors? <br>
      What happened over the last 500 generations? <br>
      Who were the people at Blombos Cave? <br>
      Or at Bhimbetka, or Lascaux, or Denisova? <br><br>
      How do we have confidence in the answers to any of these questions?
    </p>

    <p><strong>Cousin Species</strong></p>

    <p>
      Neanderthals were living in Europe for something like half a million
      years until about 40,000 years ago</br>
      Denisova people, dwarf hominins of Flores, and possibly more
    </p>

    <h3>Early Human Evolution</h3>

    <p>
      Modern humans from hail from African coasts,
      the cradle of the human brain </br>

      Much of our knowledge of humans in prehistory comes from archaeology
      and in more recent times from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-vHByC14bc">genetic
        analysis</a>

    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Ideas about how humans evolved</strong>

      üí° About 75,000 we were still colouring, making beads, learning
      chemsitry, maybe even using symbolic language.
      Afterwards, better wiring up of the brain came about possibly
      through seafood nutrients from diet <br>
      üí° There was also a period where an <i>Evolutionary bottleneck</i>
      that can be seen within human genome suggesting a population crash
      - possibly taking the population to 600 breeding adults
    </p>

    <p><strong>(Multiple) Migrations out of Africa üåç</strong></p>

    <p>
      Humans then travelled to the edges of the world.
      The extant diving bajao people of the South Philippines are
      maybe descendants of a specific such migration ...</br>
